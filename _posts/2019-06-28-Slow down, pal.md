* 1. Remind myself "You don't have to go so fast in life , just slow down and enjoy the day"

* 2. If you constantly life in the future, you go too far. Life in present 

* 3. Priorities the most important thing to you

* 4. Don't try to please everybody, you will just sacrifice yourself

* 5. Be present, enjoy your life. Don't get ahead of yourself. Say no to the things that don't give you energy

* 6. You don't feel busy
